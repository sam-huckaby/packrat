## A simple Git ~~trash~~ stash explorer

I use my stash a lot, and I like using it, but it can be hard to go back through and clean up old items and keep a sense of cleanliness when I can't just delete everything and start fresh all that often.

This is a simple tool built in Go, a language I am working on becoming more comfortable with.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
1. run `go build`
1. run `go install`
